\f1\i \cf4 \strokec4 Anglo-Saxon Chronicle}}\'a0in 1011. Deer feature in many county emblems. Many of the names of the current settlements date back to the Anglo-Saxon period, with many featuring standard placename suffixes attributed to the Anglo-Saxons: "ford", "ton", "den", "bourn", "ley", "stead", "ing", "lett", "wood", and "worth", are represented in this county by Hertford, Royston, Harpenden, Redbourn, Cuffley, Wheathampstead, Tring, Radlett, Borehamwood and Rickmansworth.\
There is evidence of human life in Hertfordshire from the\'a0{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mesolithic_period"}}{\fldrslt \cf4 \strokec4 Mesolithic period}}. It was first farmed during the\'a0{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neolithic_period"}}{\fldrslt \cf4 \strokec4 Neolithic period}}\'a0and permanent habitation appeared at the beginning of the\'a0{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bronze_Age"}}{\fldrslt \cf4 \strokec4 Bronze Age}}.

Following the\'a0{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_conquest_of_Britain"}}{\fldrslt \cf4 \strokec4 Roman conquest of Britain in AD 43}}, the aboriginal\'a0{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catuvellauni"}}{\fldrslt \cf4 \strokec4 Catuvellauni}}\'a0quickly submitted and adapted to the Roman life; resulting in the development of several new towns, including\'a0{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Verulamium"}}{\fldrslt \cf4 \strokec4 Verulamium}}\'a0(St Albans) where in c. 293 the first recorded British martyrdom is traditionally believed to have taken place.\'a0{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saint_Alban"}}{\fldrslt \cf4 \strokec4 Saint Alban}}, a Romano-British soldier, took the place of a Christian priest and was beheaded on Holywell Hill.

With the\'a0{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/End_of_Roman_rule_in_Britain"}}{\fldrslt \cf4 \strokec4 departure of the Roman Legions in the early 5th century}}, the now-unprotected territory was invaded and colonised by the\'a0{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anglo-Saxons"}}{\fldrslt \cf4 \strokec4 Anglo-Saxons}}. By the 6th century, the majority of the modern county was part of the\'a0{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/East_Saxon"}}{\fldrslt \cf4 \strokec4 East Saxon}}\'a0kingdom. This relatively short-lived kingdom collapsed in the 9th century, ceding the territory of Hertfordshire to the control of the West Anglians of\'a0{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mercia"}}{\fldrslt \cf4 \strokec4 Mercia}}. The region finally became an English shire in the 10th century, on the merger of the West Saxon and Mercian kingdoms.\
In the midst of the Norse invasions, Hertfordshire was on the front lines of much of the fighting. King\'a0{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_the_Elder"}}{\fldrslt \cf4 \strokec4 Edward the Elder}}, in his reconquest of Norse-held lands in what was to become\'a0{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England"}}{\fldrslt \cf4 \strokec4 England}}, established a "{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burh"}}{\fldrslt \cf4 \strokec4 burh}}" or fort in Hertford, which was to curb Norse activities in the area. His father,\'a0{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/King_Alfred_the_Great"}}{\fldrslt \cf4 \strokec4 King Alfred the Great}}, established the River Lea as a boundary between his kingdom and that of the Norse lord\'a0{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guthrum"}}{\fldrslt \cf4 \strokec4 Guthrum}}, with the north and eastern parts of the county being within the\'a0{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Danelaw"}}{\fldrslt \cf4 \strokec4 Danelaw}}. There is little evidence however of\'a0{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_Norse"}}{\fldrslt \cf4 \strokec4 Norse}}\'a0placenames within this region, and many of the\'a0{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anglo-Saxon"}}{\fldrslt \cf4 \strokec4 Anglo-Saxon}}\'a0features remained intact to this day. The county however suffered from renewed Norse raids in the late 10th to early 11th centuries, as armies led by\'a0{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Danish_king"}}{\fldrslt \cf4 \strokec4 Danish kings}}\'a0{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swein_Forkbeard"}}{\fldrslt \cf4 \strokec4 Swein Forkbeard}}\'a0and\'a0{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cnut_the_Great"}}{\fldrslt \cf4 \strokec4 Cnut the Great}}\'a0harried the country as part of their attempts to undermine and overthrow English king\'a0{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Athelred_the_Unready"}}{\fldrslt \cf4 \strokec4 Athelred the Unready}}.\
A century later,\'a0{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_the_Conqueror"}}{\fldrslt \cf4 \strokec4 William of Normandy}}\'a0received the surrender of the surviving senior English Lords and Clergy at\'a0{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berkhamsted"}}{\fldrslt \cf4 \strokec4 Berkhamsted}}, resulting in a new Anglicised title of\'a0{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_the_Conqueror"}}{\fldrslt \cf4 \strokec4 William the Conqueror}}, before entering London unopposed and being crowned at\'a0{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Westminster"}}{\fldrslt \cf4 \strokec4 Westminster}}. Hertfordshire was used for some of the new Norman castles at\'a0{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bishop%27s_Stortford"}}{\fldrslt \cf4 \strokec4 Bishop's Stortford}}, and at\'a0{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kings_Langley"}}{\fldrslt \cf4 \strokec4 King's Langley}}, a staging post between London and the royal residence of\'a0{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berkhamsted"}}{\fldrslt \cf4 \strokec4 Berkhamsted}}.\

In the later Plantagenet period, St. Albans Abbey was an initial drafting place of what was to become the Magna Carta. And in the later Wars of the Roses, St. Albans was the scene of two major battles between the Lancastrians and the Yorkists.\
In Tudor times,\'a0{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hatfield_House"}}{\fldrslt \cf4 \strokec4 Hatfield House}}\'a0was often frequented by Queen Elizabeth I.

As London grew, Hertfordshire became conveniently close to the English capital; much of the area was owned by the\'a0{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nobility"}}{\fldrslt \cf4 \strokec4 nobility}}\'a0and\'a0{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aristocracy"}}{\fldrslt \cf4 \strokec4 aristocracy}}, this\'a0{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patronage"}}{\fldrslt \cf4 \strokec4 patronage}}\'a0helped to boost the local economy. However, the greatest boost to Hertfordshire came during the\'a0{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Industrial_Revolution"}}{\fldrslt \cf4 \strokec4 Industrial Revolution}}, after which the population rose dramatically. In 1903,\'a0{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Letchworth"}}{\fldrslt \cf4 \strokec4 Letchworth}}\'a0became the world's first\'a0{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Garden_city_movement"}}{\fldrslt \cf4 \strokec4 garden city}}\'a0and\'a0{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stevenage"}}{\fldrslt \cf4 \strokec4 Stevenage}}\'a0became the first town to redevelop under the\'a0{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Towns_Act_1946"}}{\fldrslt \cf4 \strokec4 New Towns Act 1946}}.\
